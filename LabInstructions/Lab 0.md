## Lab 0 - Setup

1. [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install the latest release of the Java JDK.  The lab instructions have been tested with Java 7 and 8, so if you already have one of these installed you should be fine.
2. [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install Maven 2 or greater if you do not already have it.
3. Download and install an IDE if you wish to use one.  You should be able to work through the lab instructions using Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, or another IDE if desired.  You can also work on all exercises without any IDE if you prefer.
4. Create a [Github](https://github.com) account, or be prepared to create a repository using another Git account that you already have access to.
5. Download Files from [https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files](https://github.com/kennyk65/Microservices-With-Spring-Student-Files) (Use download ZIP, or Clone in Desktop, whichever you prefer)
6. Import all of the downloaded Maven projects into your IDE.
7. Optional - Find and install a REST plugin for the web browser that you would like to use for this course.  For example, I use "Simple REST Client" in Chrome.

Notice that:
- Not all subfolders within the student files contain Maven projects.  Some contain the lab instructions, such as this document that your are reading now.
- Projects are grouped by lab #, each corresponding to a module in the course.
- Projects suffixed with “solution” are intended to illustrate the completed version of each lab.  Try to complete each lab without peeking at the solutions, but if you get stuck they are available to you.
